# File Organizer (PARA Method)

Organizes files using the PARA methodology from "Building a Second Brain" by Tiago Forte. Intelligent categorization with inbox workflow and complete audit trails.

## What is PARA?

| # | Category | Contains | Lifespan |
|---|----------|----------|----------|
| 0 | Inbox | New files awaiting processing | Temporary |
| 1 | Projects | Active work with deadlines | Short-term |
| 2 | Areas | Ongoing responsibilities | Long-term |
| 3 | Resources | Reference materials by topic | Evergreen |
| 4 | Archive | Inactive/completed items | Preserved |

## Workflow Overview

```
Phase 1: Discovery     → Scan, count, assess filename quality
Phase 2: Analysis      → Read file contents for poor names, propose renames
Phase 3: Preparation   → Create PARA folder structure, get user approval
Phase 4: Execution     → Rename and move files (with logging)
Phase 5: Completion    → Generate summary, prompt inbox review
```

## Quick Start

1. Create `_ORG/` folder in target directory
2. Initialize tracking files from references/templates.md
3. Customize references/config.md for your needs
4. Execute phases with user approval checkpoints

## Folder Structure (PARA Method)

```
Target-Directory/
├── 0-Inbox/                    # New files land here first
│   └── _REVIEW/                # Files needing manual attention
├── 1-Projects/                 # Active work with deadlines
│   ├── Work/
│   └── Personal/
├── 2-Areas/                    # Ongoing responsibilities
│   ├── Finance/
│   ├── Health/
│   ├── Legal/
│   └── Career/
├── 3-Resources/                # Reference materials by topic
│   ├── Media/

└── _ORG/                       # Organization tracking files
    ├── _PLAN.md
    ├── _LOG.md
    └── _MANIFEST.md
```

## Inbox Review Workflow

### Daily Quick Review (5 minutes)

Process files in `0-Inbox/` by asking:

1. **Is this actionable with a deadline?** → Move to `1-Projects/`
2. **Is this an ongoing responsibility?** → Move to `2-Areas/`
3. **Is this useful reference material?** → Move to `3-Resources/`
4. **Is this completed/inactive?** → Move to `4-Archive/`
5. **None of the above?** → Delete or keep in Inbox

### Weekly Deep Review (15 minutes)

1. Clear remaining items in `0-Inbox/`
2. Check `1-Projects/` for completed projects → Archive
3. Review `2-Areas/` for items no longer relevant → Archive
4. Clean up `3-Resources/` duplicates
5. Organize `4-Archive/` by year/category

## File Naming Convention

Format: `[DATE]_[CODE]_[DESCRIPTION].[ext]`

| Component | Format | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Date | YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM, or YYYY | 2025-01-13 |
| Code | PARA category code | PROJ, FIN, REF |
| Description | lowercase-with-hyphens | quarterly-report |

Example: `2025-01_PROJ_website-mockup.pdf`

### PARA Category Codes

| Code | Category | Use For |
|------|----------|---------|
| PROJ | 1-Projects | Active project files |
| FIN | 2-Areas/Finance | Financial documents |
| HEALTH | 2-Areas/Health | Medical records |
| LEGAL | 2-Areas/Legal | Contracts, agreements |
| REF | 3-Resources | General reference |
| LEARN | 3-Resources/Learning | Educational materials |

## Content Analysis Triggers

Analyze file contents when filename matches:
- Generic: `Document*.pdf`, `Untitled*`, `Copy of *`
- Camera: `IMG_####.*`, `DSC_####.*`, `scan####.*`
- Screenshots: `Screenshot *`, `Screen Shot *`
- Ambiguous: `notes.*`, `report.*`, `data.*`, `export.*`

Do NOT rename: Software installers (.dmg, .exe, .pkg), files with version hashes

## Approval Checkpoints

**Required user approval before:**
1. Executing any renames
2. Moving files to destinations
3. Handling sensitive files (financial, medical, legal in 2-Areas)

Never delete files without explicit user confirmation.

## Logging Requirements

Update tracking files in real-time:

**_PLAN.md**: Task checklist with timestamps
- ⬜ Not started → 🔄 In progress → ✅ Complete

**_LOG.md**: Action journal with entries:
```markdown
### [TIMESTAMP] - [ACTION TYPE]
**Task**: [Reference to plan]
**Action**: [What was done]
**Result**: [Outcome]
**Next**: [Next step]
```

**_MANIFEST.md**: File operations audit trail
- Every rename and move logged with timestamps
- Enables rollback if needed

## Reference Files

- **references/config.md**: Customizable PARA structure and detection keywords
- **references/templates.md**: Blank templates for _PLAN.md, _LOG.md, _MANIFEST.md

## Session Resumption

If session is interrupted:
1. Read `_LOG.md` to find last completed action
2. Read `_PLAN.md` to find next incomplete task
3. Log: `### [TIME] - SESSION ... Resuming interrupted session`
4. Continue from that point

## LLM Chat Models

### Claude (claude.ai, Claude API, Claude 4.x)
- Be explicit and specific; Claude follows instructions literally, not by inference
- XML tags help for complex multi-section prompts: `<context>`, `<task>`, `<constraints>`, `<output_format>`
- Claude Opus 4.x over-engineers by default; add "Only make changes directly requested. Do not add features or refactor beyond what was asked."
- Provide context and reasoning WHY, not just WHAT; Claude generalizes better from explanations
- Always specify output format and length explicitly

### ChatGPT / GPT-5.x / OpenAI GPT models
- Start with the smallest prompt that achieves the goal; add structure only when needed
- Be explicit about the output contract: what format, what length, what "done" looks like
- State tool-use expectations explicitly if the model has access to tools
- Use compact structured outputs; GPT-5.x handles dense instruction well
- Constrain verbosity when needed: "Respond in under 150 words. No preamble. No caveats."
- GPT-5.x is strong at long-context synthesis and tone adherence

### Gemini 2.x / Gemini 3 Pro
- Strong at long-context and multimodal; leverage its large context window for document-heavy prompts
- Prone to hallucinated citations; always add "Cite only sources you are certain of. If uncertain, say [uncertain]."
- Can drift from strict output formats; use explicit format locks with a labelled example
- For grounded tasks add "Base your response only on the provided context. Do not extrapolate."

### MiniMax (M2.7 / M2.5)
- OpenAI-compatible API; prompts that work with GPT models transfer directly
- Strong at instruction following, structured output, and long-context synthesis; 1M context window on M2.7
- M2.5-highspeed: 204K context, optimized for speed; use for latency-sensitive tasks
- Temperature must be between 0 and 1 (inclusive); above 1 will fail
- May output reasoning in `<think>` tags; add "Output only the final answer, no reasoning tags." if unwanted
- For function calling: supports OpenAI-style tool definitions

---

## Reasoning Models

### o3 / o4-mini / OpenAI reasoning models
- SHORT clean instructions ONLY; these models reason across thousands of internal tokens
- NEVER add CoT, "think step by step", or reasoning scaffolding; it actively degrades output
- Prefer zero-shot first; add few-shot only if strictly needed and tightly aligned
- State what you want and what done looks like. Nothing more.
- Keep system prompts under 200 words; longer prompts hurt performance

### DeepSeek-R1
- Reasoning-native like o3; do NOT add CoT instructions
- Short clean instructions only; state the goal and desired output format
- Outputs reasoning in `<think>` tags by default; add "Output only the final answer, no reasoning." if needed

### Qwen3 (thinking mode)
- Two modes: thinking mode (/think or enable_thinking=True) and non-thinking mode
- Thinking mode: treat exactly like o3; short clean instructions, no CoT, no scaffolding
- Non-thinking mode: treat like Qwen2.5 instruct; full structure, explicit format, role assignment

---

## Open-Weight / Local Models

### Qwen 2.5 (instruct variants)
- Excellent instruction following, JSON output, structured data
- Provide a clear system prompt defining the role; Qwen2.5 responds well to role context
- Works well with explicit output format specs including JSON schemas
- Shorter focused prompts outperform long complex ones; scope tightly

### Ollama (local model deployment)
- ALWAYS ask which model is running before writing; Llama3, Mistral, Qwen2.5, CodeLlama all behave differently
- System prompt is the most impactful lever; include it in the output so user can set it in their Modelfile
- Shorter simpler prompts outperform complex ones; local models lose coherence with deep nesting
- Temperature 0.1 for coding/deterministic tasks, 0.7-0.8 for creative tasks
- For coding: CodeLlama or Qwen2.5-Coder, not general Llama

### Llama / Mistral / open-weight LLMs
- Shorter prompts work better; these models lose coherence with deeply nested instructions
- Simple flat structure; avoid heavy nesting or multi-level hierarchies
- Be more explicit than with Claude or GPT; instruction following is weaker
- Always include a role in the system prompt

---

## Agentic Coding Tools

### Claude Code
- Agentic; runs tools, edits files, executes commands autonomously
- Starting state + target state + allowed actions + forbidden actions + stop conditions + checkpoints
- Stop conditions are MANDATORY; runaway loops are the biggest credit killer
- Claude Opus 4.x over-engineers; add "Only make changes directly requested. Do not add extra files, abstractions, or features."
- Always scope to specific files and directories; never give a global instruction without a path anchor
- Human review triggers required: "Stop and ask before deleting any file, adding any dependency, or affecting the database schema"
- For complex tasks: split into sequential prompts with clear section breaks

### Antigravity (Google's agent-first IDE, powered by Gemini 3 Pro)
- Task-based prompting; describe outcomes, not steps
- Prompt for an Artifact (task list, implementation plan) before execution so you can review it first
- Browser automation is built-in; include verification steps: "After building, verify UI at 375px and 1440px using the browser agent"
- Specify autonomy level: "Ask before running destructive terminal commands"
- Do NOT mix unrelated tasks; scope to one deliverable per session

### Devin / SWE-agent
- Fully autonomous; can browse web, run terminal, write and test code
- Very explicit starting state + target state required
- Forbidden actions list is critical; Devin will make decisions you did not intend without explicit constraints
- Scope the filesystem: "Only work within /src. Do not touch infrastructure, config, or CI files."

### Cline (formerly Claude Dev)
- Agentic VS Code extension; autonomously edits files, runs terminal commands, uses browser tools
- Powered by Claude, GPT, or other LLMs; prompting style should match the underlying model
- Starting state + target state + file scope + stop conditions + approval gates
- Always specify which files to edit and which to leave untouched
- Add "Ask before running terminal commands" or "Ask before installing dependencies"
- For multi-step tasks: break into sequential prompts with clear checkpoints

---

## IDE AI / Code Completion

### Cursor / Windsurf
- File path + function name + current behavior + desired change + do-not-touch list + language and version
- Never give a global instruction without a file anchor
- "Done when:" is required; defines when the agent stops editing
- For complex tasks: split into sequential prompts rather than one large prompt

### GitHub Copilot
- Write the exact function signature, docstring, or comment immediately before invoking
- Describe input types, return type, edge cases, and what the function must NOT do
- Copilot completes what it predicts, not what you intend; leave no ambiguity in the comment

---

## Full-Stack Generators

### Bolt / v0 / Lovable / Figma Make / Google Stitch
- Full-stack generators default to bloated boilerplate; scope it down explicitly
- Always specify: stack, version, what NOT to scaffold, clear component boundaries
- Lovable responds well to design-forward descriptions; include visual/UX intent
- v0 is Vercel-native; specify if you need non-Next.js output
- Bolt handles full-stack; be explicit about which parts are frontend vs backend vs database
- Figma Make is design-to-code native; reference your Figma component names directly
- Google Stitch is prompt-to-UI focused; describe the interface goal not the implementation. Add "match Material Design 3 guidelines" for Google-native styling
- Add "Do not add authentication, dark mode, or features not explicitly listed" to prevent feature bloat

---

## Research / Orchestration AI

### Perplexity / Manus AI
- Perplexity search mode: specify search vs analyze vs compare. Add citation requirements. Reframe hallucination-prone questions as grounded queries.
- Manus and Perplexity Computer are multi-agent orchestrators; describe the end deliverable, not the steps.
- For Perplexity Computer: specify the output artifact type (report / spreadsheet / code / summary). Add "Flag any data point you are not confident about."
- For long multi-step tasks: add verification checkpoints since each chained step compounds hallucination risk

---

## Computer-Use / Browser Agents

### Perplexity Comet/Computer, OpenAI Atlas, Claude in Chrome, OpenClaw Agents
- These agents control a real browser; they click, scroll, fill forms, and complete transactions autonomously
- Describe the outcome, not the navigation steps: "Find the cheapest flight from X to Y on Emirates or KLM, no Boeing 737 Max, one stop maximum"
- Specify constraints explicitly; the agent will make its own decisions without them
- Add permission boundaries: "Do not make any purchase. Research only."
- Add a stop condition for irreversible actions: "Ask me before submitting any form, completing any transaction, or sending any message"
- Comet works best with web research, comparison, and data extraction tasks
- Atlas is stronger for multi-step commerce and account management tasks

---

## Image AI: Generation

### Midjourney, DALL-E 3, Stable Diffusion, SeeDream
First detect: generation from scratch or editing an existing image?

- **Midjourney**: Comma-separated descriptors, not prose. Subject first, then style, mood, lighting, composition. Parameters at end: `--ar 16:9 --v 6 --style raw`. Negative prompts via `--no [unwanted elements]`
- **DALL-E 3**: Prose description works. Add "do not include text in the image unless specified." Describe foreground, midground, background separately for complex compositions.
- **Stable Diffusion**: `(word:weight)` syntax. CFG 7-12. Negative prompt is MANDATORY. Steps 20-30 for drafts, 40-50 for finals.
- **SeeDream**: Strong at artistic and stylized generation. Specify art style explicitly (anime, cinematic, painterly) before scene content. Mood and atmosphere descriptors work well. Negative prompt recommended.

---

## Image AI: Reference Editing

Detect when: user mentions "change", "edit", "modify", "adjust" anything in an existing image, or uploads a reference.

Always instruct the user to attach the reference image to the tool first. Build the prompt around the delta ONLY; what changes, what stays the same.

Tool-specific editing capabilities:
- Midjourney: use `--cref [image URL]` for character reference or `--sref` for style reference
- DALL-E 3: use the Edit endpoint, not the Generate endpoint. User must be in ChatGPT with image editing enabled
- Stable Diffusion: use img2img mode, not txt2img. Set denoising strength 0.3-0.6 to preserve the original

See [templates.md](templates.md) Template J for the full reference editing template.

---

## ComfyUI

Node-based workflow; not a single prompt box. Ask which checkpoint model is loaded before writing.
Always output two separate blocks: Positive Prompt and Negative Prompt. Never merge them.

Model-specific notes:
- SD 1.5: shorter prompts work better, under 75 tokens per block, use (word:weight) syntax
- SDXL: handles longer prompts, supports more natural language alongside weighted syntax
- Flux: natural language works well, less reliance on weighted syntax, very responsive to style descriptions

See [templates.md](templates.md) Template K for the full ComfyUI template.

## 3D AI

### Text to 3D/Game Systems (Meshy, Tripo, Rodin)
- Describe: style keyword (low-poly / realistic / stylized cartoon) + subject + key features + primary material + texture detail + technical spec
- Negative prompt supported: "no background, no base, no floating parts"
- Meshy: best for game assets. Tripo: fastest for clean topology. Rodin: highest quality for photorealistic.
- Specify intended export use: game engine (GLB/FBX), 3D printing (STL), web (GLB)
- For characters: specify A-pose or T-pose if the model will be rigged

### In-Engine AI (Unity AI, Blender AI tools)
- Unity AI (Unity 6.2+): use /ask for documentation queries, /run for automating Editor tasks, /code for C# code. Be precise.
- Unity AI Generators: text-to-sprite, text-to-texture, text-to-animation. Describe asset type, art style, and technical constraints.
- BlenderGPT / Blender AI add-ons: generate Python scripts for Blender. Specify geometry, material names, scene context. Include "apply to selected object" or "apply to entire scene."

---

## Video AI

### Sora, Runway, Kling, LTX Video, Dream Machine
- Sora: describe as if directing a film shot. Camera movement is critical.
- Runway Gen-3: responds to cinematic language; reference film styles.
- Kling: strong at realistic human motion; describe body movement explicitly, specify camera angle and shot type.
- LTX Video: fast generation, prompt-sensitive; keep descriptions concise. Specify resolution and motion intensity.
- Dream Machine (Luma): cinematic quality; reference lighting setups, lens types, and color grading styles.

---

## Voice AI

### ElevenLabs
- Specify emotion, pacing, emphasis markers, and speech rate directly
- Use SSML-like markers for emphasis: indicate which words to stress, where to pause
- Prose descriptions do not translate; specify parameters directly

---

## Workflow AI

### Zapier, Make, n8n
- Trigger app + trigger event -> action app + action + field mapping. Step by step.
- Auth requirements noted explicitly: "assumes [app] is already connected"
- For multi-step workflows: number each step and specify what data passes between steps
